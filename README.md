# What is Markdown?

_**Markdown** is a plain text formatting syntax for writers. It allows you to quickly write structured content for the web, and have it seamlessly converted to clean, structured HTML._

## Basic Markdown Formatting

### Headings

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Text

```
*italic* or _italic_
**bold**
***bold-italic***
```

**_To add a link: wrap the text which you want to be linked in square brackets, followed by the URL to be linked to in parenthesis._**

```
[text] and (place to go when the button is clicked)
```

### Images

_Markdown images have exactly the same formatting as a link, except theyâ€™re prefixed with a !. This time, the text in brackets is the alt text - or the descriptive text for the image._
