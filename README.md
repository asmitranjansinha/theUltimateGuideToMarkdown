# What is Markdown?

_**Markdown** is a plain text formatting syntax for writers. It allows you to quickly write structured content for the web, and have it seamlessly converted to clean, structured HTML._

## Basic Markdown Formatting

### Headings

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Text

```
*italic* or _italic_
**bold**
***bold-italic***
```

**_To add a link: wrap the text which you want to be linked in square brackets, followed by the URL to be linked to in parenthesis._**

```
[text] and (place to go when the button is clicked)
```

Example: [Refresh](https://github.com/asmitranjansinha/theUltimateGuideToMarkdown)

### Images

_Markdown images have exactly the same formatting as a link, except theyâ€™re prefixed with a !. This time, the text in brackets is the alt text - or the descriptive text for the image._

```
![ImageTitle] and (ImageUrl)
```

### List

_For a bullet list, just prefix each like with a \* - or - or + and they will be converted to dots. You can also create nested lists; just indent a line with 4 spaces and it will be nested under the line above._

```
* Main
* Main
    * Sub
* Main
```

Example:
- Feature
- Feature
  - Components
- Feature

### Quotes

There's not much to say about this, you just have to use:

```
> your quotes go here.
```

Example:
> I drink and I know things!  
> -Tyrion
